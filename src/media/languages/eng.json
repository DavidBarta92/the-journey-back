    "trivia_A_1_text" : "For Martian settlers, one of the greatest challenges is the length of the days and nights. A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours and 39 minutes long, which might seem like a minor difference at first, but in the long term, it significantly impacts the human biological clock. The human body struggles to adapt to this new rhythm, leading to sleep disorders, fatigue and psychological issues. Martian doctors have developed new 'rhythm stimulators' to regulate the body's internal clock to better align with Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_A_2_title" : "Terraforming: An Ironic Effect",
    "trivia_A_2_text" : "During the process of terraforming Mars, scientists faced an ironic effect: the gradual transformation of the planet into a habitable environment poses the greatest risk to the Martian settlers. The increasing oxygen levels and the slow rise in surface temperature are triggering rapid changes which the human-built bases and domes were not designed to withstand. ",
    "trivia_A_3_title" : "The 'Mars Cathedral': A Symbol of Science",
    "trivia_A_3_text" : "One of Mars's largest artificial structures is a massive dome-shaped building simply called the 'Mars Cathedral'. This facility is a symbol of the triumph of science, a temple that houses the research center of the Martian colony. The place where the scientists responsible for terraforming and the future of the planet work. People often come here to witness the wonders of science and draw inspiration for their efforts to save Earth. The 'ceremonies' held in the Cathedral celebrate scientific discoveries.",    
    "trivia_A_4_title" : "Martian Religion: The 'Cult of Rebirth'",
    "trivia_A_4_text" : "A new form of religion has developed on Mars, interpreting the terraforming process on a spiritual level. Followers of the 'Cult of Rebirth' view Mars as a sacred place where humanity can start anew. For them, terraforming is not only a scientific process but also a symbolic rebirth. They believe that transforming Mars is part of humanity's spiritual renewal, and every step taken to make the planet habitable brings them closer to a new, purer form of existence.",

    "trivia_B_1_title": "Martian Plants: The Carbon Dioxide Planet",
    "trivia_B_1_text": "The biggest challenge in Martian agriculture is the extremely low temperatures and radiation damage, which makes it impossible for Earth-based plants to adapt. Scientists are trying to develop genetic modifications that would enable plants to use the Martian carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere for energy production - makin them more resistant. Experiments are ongoing, but no plant has survived the open Martian conditions yet.",
    "trivia_B_2_title": "The 'Photosynthesis Problem': Sunlight on the Red Planet",
    "trivia_B_2_text": "Mars is farther from the Sun, so sunlight intensity is significantly weaker than on Earth. This presents a serious obstacle for plants, as the sunlight needed for photosynthesis is much less. Scientists are working on developing plants that can generate energy from less light, but this remains a challenge. Some researchers are experimenting with artificial light sources to compensate for the lack of solar energy, but long-term sustainability is still uncertain.",
    "trivia_B_3_title": "The Plant Gene Bank: Seeds of Hope",
    "trivia_B_3_text" : "On Mars, there is a vast plant gene bank that preserves thousands of Earth plant species. This gene bank is a symbol of hope for Martian settlers, as these seeds could form the foundation for future Martian agriculture. The genetic codes of each plant species are constantly analyzed and modified to create varieties that will one day be able to survive on the Martian surface. The research is ongoing, but it still seems like a distant dream that these seeds will one day sprout on the Red Planet.",
    "trivia_B_4_title": "Cynara cardunculus var. areophila",
    "trivia_B_4_text": "The artichoke is a thistle-like vegetable and medicinal herb native to North Africa. It has been consumed since ancient Greek times. Due to its special abilities, such as high salt tolerance, heat resistance and drought resistance, Martian researchers consider it a potential candidate for the future Martian ecosystem. Although a truly Martian-tolerant variant is still awaited, the Cynara cardunculus var. areophila is frequently mentioned, with 'Cynara' being the original genus and 'cardunculus' the specific name for the artichoke. The term 'areophila' refers to 'Mars,' the Greek god Ares, and '-phila' means 'lover' or 'friend', so 'Mars-lover.'",
    
    "trivia_C_1_title": "The Basis of Interstellar Travel: Mental Stabilizers",
    "trivia_C_1_text": "For humanity, space travel has became a routine, but the several-month journey between Earth and Mars poses a massive psychological burden for astronauts. The vast emptiness, the silent glow of the stars and the endless silence have a daunting effect on astronauts' minds. Recent developments have introduced special neurochemical-based devices,'mental stabilizers', that alleviate the mental pressure and prevent the mind from wandering.",
    "trivia_C_2_title": "Reduced Gravity and Muscle Loss",
    "trivia_C_2_text": "The gravity on Mars is only 38% of Earth's. The reduced gravity places makes the muscular system work less, causing progressive bone density loss (osteoporosis) and muscle weakness. To counteract this, settlers must engage in daily gravitational training and resistance exercises using specialized equipment that simulates artificial gravity.",
    "trivia_C_3_title": "Radiation-Induced Genetic Damage",
    "trivia_C_3_text": "Mars's thin atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field provide no protection against cosmic radiation and solar wind, unlike Earth. Prolonged radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer and damages DNA, leading to potential genetic mutations. Researchers are continuously improving radiation-shielded habitat modules and clothing, but radiation exposure remains one of the greatest health challenges for Mars colonization.",
    
    "trivia_D_1_title": "How Does a Martian Plant Research Farm Work?",
    "trivia_D_1_text": "Martian plant research farms are closed, self-sustaining systems designed to develop and cultivate plants necessary for Mars colonization. The greenhouse modules use hydroponic and aeroponic systems to minimize water usage while providing optimal nutrient delivery. These farms are managed by artificial intelligence, which continuously monitors and adjusts the internal environment, such as temperature, light levels, humidity and carbon dioxide concentration. The research farms can analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of plants to identify species most adaptable to Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_D_2_title": "Air Circulation and Life Support on a Martian Base",
    "trivia_D_2_text": "The air circulation systems of Martian research farms and associated habitats operate on a closed-loop principle known as 'bioactive air filtration.' This system combines the natural photosynthesis of plants, which converts carbon dioxide into oxygen with artificial filters and chemical catalysts that remove harmful substances from the air. A central air pump regulates air exchange between farm and habitat modules. Water and air recycling are tightly integrated into the system: moisture released through plant transpiration is captured by a condensation unit and reused in the hydroponic system, while the carbon dioxide exhaled by inhabitants is utilized for photosynthesis in the farm. Until the senzor supervision is working the redundant systems ensure that no single failure endangers the ecosystem's functionality.",
    "trivia_D_3_title": "Failure of a Martian Farm",
    "trivia_D_3_text": "A Martian farm is an extremely sensitive system where small faults can lead to catastrophic consequences. One of the most vulnerable aspects is gas circulation and management which is monitored by a sensor control system. The closed atmosphere of the farm is optimized for controlling oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, but if the CO2 removal system fails, dangerous gas imbalances can quickly develop. Explosions can be triggered in the system through several mechanisms: gas accumulation, nutrient solution failures, energy system malfunctions, inactivating the senzor system.",

For unknown reasons, an explosion occurred at the research station, causing it to malfunction, and the Cathedral (the central Martian base) lost contact with Teo, the only inhabitant of AGX1-0203.

Back then, people relied on simple measurements and the mental maps they carried within. It’s as if the inner and outer worlds were more mixed. Unknown lands were full of challenges and dangers, and old maps often marked them with symbols. Did you know mapmakers would draw dragons where no one had been? It wasn’t just a warning about unknown dangers, but also a kind of tribute to the unknown. 'Terra incognita,' that’s what they wrote—dragons were metaphors, in a way.",

When I first arrived, the planet was even drier, and only now are we starting to see signs of marshes forming, the temperature rising slightly, and the atmosphere thickening. But it’s a slow process.

There are also plans to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—or perhaps they've already started. The second phase will involve introducing plants. That’s where my work would come in.",

How do we move forward? Where do we go from here? There is no one who sees the bigger picture, who can tell us that we are wandering aimlessly.

All in all I think it helped people understand their inner struggles. And maybe not just on the battlefield... But sometimes these stories are cruel, they warn us, if you like. There's the case of Prometheus or Atlas, for example, who confronted the gods. Both were punished for eternal life.",

Although sometimes I feel that real-life problems, or perhaps just nowadays, are more complex than such stories can provide direction for. Often, they speak more about what not to do rather than what to do. For example, the stories of Atlas and Prometheus.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op1_1": "Aiza: This interpretation is interesting, but I think there is another part as well. War can be a metaphor for life, with fear as its companion. I see them as synonyms for the fear hidden within humans. How should I put it... Perhaps the greatest lesson is that our biggest struggles are always internal, and I think it’s worth remembering because it helps understand and manage our inner conflicts.",

    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op1_op1": "Aiza: When I was a child, I didn’t pay attention to this, but these stories aren’t just about adventure. What’s great about them is that each one is also an inner journey. Often, it’s precisely the wandering, the feeling of being lost in the unknown, that brings about realizations we could never find on a well-trodden path. These tales show that the people of ancient times struggled with their own limitations just like we do today.",

Others may never reach the point where they discover these hidden parts because they are afraid of what they might find there.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op2_op2": "Aiza: Since we were talking about dragons... It might be that we fear that if we confront these hidden fears or questions, those inner dragons we have buried so carefully will awaken and turn against us. This might shape the direction to move on this inner map.",

    "dia_C6_M4_op1_2": "Aiza: From what you’re saying, it seems to me that you were never truly happy. You didn’t like living on Earth if that’s all you saw of it. You portray everyone as foolish and powerless, but in reality, you’re just projecting your own feelings and helplessness onto others. You wouldn’t have left if I hadn’t come for you. But since it has come to this, look within yourself, think of the old stories if it helps... but start really coming back to us.",

They wander aimlessly, which is why I left.",
    "dia_C6_M4_op2_2": "Aiza: Honestly, I don’t believe people are so foolish as to be deceived so easily. The problem lies elsewhere. You know? In reality, they’re avoiding an uncomfortable thought. The thought that while they’re hiding, they’re complicit in everything that causes their anxiety. There is no other way out but to face it. Movement is necessary! You’ve said so much bad about Earth, but to me, the worst part is that most people, including you, have now turned away from hope. Anything that is hopeful is false. Why do you think that is?",

I’m trying to figure out what happened to you, but you won’t let me in—you’re always lost in old memories, so distrustful. Why do you assume the worst right away?",

    "dia_C7_S11_1": "Teo: When I arrived, the program was already in full swing. I had been part of it from the beginning, but I only joined the Mars research later. In the beginning, I was busy managing the Earth-based team. We had some major successes, and using Thomas’ connections, we quickly secured the funding to relocate the research station off-planet within 10 years. Everyone said the Moon should be the first step, but we were adamant. That would have been a major step forward in terms of soil analysis, but the Moon has no atmosphere. Since the Earth's biosphere is rapidly deteriorating and extreme weather events are increasing, we needed to find a place that was as bad, or worse, than Earth would be in 50 years. Since Mars had already captured many people’s imaginations, there were plenty of volunteers to work on terraforming Martian plants.",
    "dia_C7_S11_2": "Teo: Thomas always understood people better, and he rose up to high circles. No wonder they sent him here first, to the Cathedral. After a while, though, it became untenable for me to work solely with the data sent back to Earth. We realized I needed to be here, especially when terraforming really got underway. Materials were being released from the melted soil that completely changed its quality. In some places, small lakes formed, and elsewhere geysers emerged. This allowed us to start working outside the Cathedral, in places where geological changes were taking place. I wasn’t exactly young then, but they made sure the consortium sent me here. Although I wasn’t a trained astronaut, I tried to acclimate quickly. I wanted to dive in, I can't stand helplessness, and I had sacrificed so many years for this, a whole life.",
    "dia_C7_S12_1": "Aiza: But things were still good between you two, right?",
    "dia_C7_S12_2": "Teo: Of course. However, when I got here, I noticed the disintegration. I couldn’t hold myself back for long. Thomas talks a lot about other projects, what they need to meet, how few people there are, etc. And all I felt was anger, that he dragged me here and this is what I got. I wanted everyone to focus solely on the biodome research at the Icarus base. The Cathedral didn’t go for that, and slowly people started to give in to the pressure. At one point, I said that anyone not working on my project could go back. So I continued alone.",
    "dia_C7_S14_1": "Aiza: But Thomas still kept in touch with you then.",
    "dia_C7_S14_2": "Teo: He was only interested in the results, that’s all. We talked some more, but it was just about practical matters. He’s no different from the other politicians or those running the consortium. He spent so much time with them, he became one of them. He just talks, but says nothing. I didn’t come here for that, I came to show something. I don’t want to be like them. Then, of course, I realized the consortium is like a tree, with roots that go deep. You don’t start with the leaders or the researchers here if you want to find those responsible.",
    "dia_C7_S15": "Aiza: Responsible people?",
    "dia_C7_S17_1": "Teo: Because nothing is happening. I was so naïve in the beginning. I thought this whole institution was a force that moved mountains, an incredible effort just to save the Earth.",
    "dia_C7_S17_2": "Aiza: And it’s not like that?",
    "dia_C7_S17_3": "Teo: Thomas once explained to me that the investors are already worried that the project will never pay off, that there’s been no result for so long. And that they’re putting much more money into projects aiming at colonizing the Moon and Mars. He said: 'You know, investment is a promise for the future.' Nobody cares about Earth anymore. Nobody... And the same thing will happen elsewhere.",

I really want to help, but that’ll only work if you face some things. I don’t want to hurt you, and I don’t want you to hurt yourself either. But you need to see that not everyone around you is evil, and it’s not that they always leave you behind. As long as you hide in this safe mourning, you’re actually abandoning everyone else.

Maybe it’s because I felt so alone when I was younger—maybe I still feel alone because of it. When we were together as kids, it really meant a lot to me. For some strange reason, I felt guilty for years. It was like... like there was a glass wall separating me from everything, and I felt like I was the one who put it there. I don’t know if you understand me. I work with people. I don’t think anyone could say I shut myself off from others.

We’ve passed down from generation to generation everything that’s causing our suffering now. Even if we get any tools in our hands to numb the pain, we’ll still pass down the same harmful patterns.

The ability to feel and see that what we do affects everything, not just our immediate surroundings but also places far from us. Humans are a global entity, and we need the ecosystem. But all I see is that everyone is just strengthening the individual. People think they’re special, but they’re not. Anyone who has ever lived with nature, anyone who has ever seen... a bird, knows that they communicate, they have feelings, and basically, the same things motivate them as us.",
    "negative_C9_S8_8": "Teo: But the biggest mistake is not thinking we’re special, but simply thinking that everything that doesn’t serve our imagined goals is unnecessary. How many types of weeds do we recognize that need to be eliminated, and how many do we see as useful? As soon as we start removing elements from a system, it weakens, and over time, it collapses. Everyone worries about global warming, that 'we will destroy the planet.' We’re not even close to that. We’re going to destroy our comfortable lives. There’s only one way humanity will survive, through adaptation. Of course, there’s migration. We’ll come here, but then we’ll have to adapt to Mars. Otherwise, we’ll fulfill the same destiny we did on Earth.",

We didn’t talk about it, you didn’t ask, I didn’t say anything, it doesn’t matter. I don’t think it was just my fault, but I’ve been busy with my own responsibility lately. At first, I only thought about what I messed up between us. Then it also occurred to me why I’m like this. Dad and Mom also divorced, you did too. Grandma has been gone for a long time. And when I thought it through, I realized that I have no one to talk to. But I knew you were here. I also knew I could reach you. I even suspected you weren’t doing well. But I kept putting it off.",

I always told myself that it should be Grandpa’s job to look for you. If he loves you, he should search for you. Then I realized that it’s me who goes to sleep with these thoughts, I have to push them away. And maybe that’s the answer to what you said: I have to break this chain. The problem is in the past, but I need to act now. I need to get out of the swamp.",

I don’t think it was all my fault, but I’ve been focused on my own responsibilities lately. I’m aware of everything you’ve said. I felt empty and aimless. I asked myself, ‘What did all those years go to?’ At first, I only thought about what I did wrong in our relationship. Then, I realized why I was alone with this question. My parents got divorced, so did you. Grandma’s been gone for a long time. And when I reflected on all of this, I realized how rootless I am.",
    "positive_C9_S8_7": "Aiza: At first, I was angry. As I sank into this comfortable melancholy, I gradually convinced myself that everyone else was to blame for everything falling apart around me that could be called family. The truth is, even as a little girl, I mostly saw your backs. Except for a few occasions we talked about, you didn’t care about me. But you’re completely right in what you said. We pass this on to each other. I made the same mistake in my relationship that you made. I was cold, distant, but most of all, blind. Blind to how I acted and how it affected others. I didn’t see how many people are connected to me. That everything I do, or don’t do, has an impact on me and everyone around me.",

    "positive_C9_S8_10": "Aiza: I don’t think our job is to turn back. But I do think that what’s happening to Earth, what’s happening to all of us, actually depends on how we treat each other. Maybe this, what you’re looking for, is responsibility. The ability to feel and see that what we do affects everything, everyone, not just our immediate surroundings but places far from us too. This is true for our family, and it’s true for what we’re doing to Earth. Maybe the root of all our suffering lies in the past. But what matters, I think, is what we do here and now.",

Being on Mars, synthetic fertilizer, penicillin — all are extraordinary breakthroughs and useful. But of course… how many terrible things have we done over the past centuries? Clearly, it depends on people how they use the knowledge they acquire. Clearly… That’s enough for today.",

I was thinking the other day how often we think of ourselves as surpassing the generations of past centuries, but in reality, we haven’t. Not at all! The fact that our society is based on science doesn't mean that people actually understand what scientific thinking is. Just like before, people live according to their desires. Instinctual beings. The existence of vehicles and modern tools for communication, or even artificial intelligence, doesn’t mean we understand how they work. How many people use these tools? Almost everyone.

I’m starting to give up on the whole thing. Continuing from my previous train of thought: obviously, not everyone needs to understand everything. These are complex matters, and it’s not reasonable to expect someone to understand their tools down to the last screw before using them. It’s natural that multiple people’s knowledge must be combined to create such a tool so that anyone can use it. But still… I feel like something is off. I don’t even know how to put it. Maybe I just need to rest.",

I had a thought today while talking to the AI assistant about the new species. It’s here with me. It gives the impression of a real person, but can it truly provide everything a real person could? Clearly not. So why do we even strive to make it resemble a real person?",

This thought won’t leave me alone. I tossed and turned all night. I don’t even like talking to the AI anymore. Then I remembered something — how little we understand our own tools. I’m still stuck on this thought… Take a house, for example. People need houses, but typically one person alone can’t build one. It takes coordinated work by multiple people so that eventually anyone, even alone, can move in. And that’s fine. But AI is different. The difference is, when we talk about a house, we understand what it is. The concept is graspable by the human mind. We understand why we need it, how and for what to use it. We even understand how it works — we know what makes a house a house. But with AI, it’s not just that we don’t know what happens under the hood, but we also don’t really know what our role is with it. Why and how to use it, what effects it has on us and our lives. We don’t really know what this thing is that we’re using.",
    "note_10": "Soil analyses on Mars are ongoing. The plants’ resistance is satisfactory, but I still don’t feel well. Yesterday I wondered if the mission makes any sense. I have doubts about the ethical nature of the research. I keep thinking about who all this is really for. More precisely: whether what we call humanity truly benefits from all this. I had an idea — maybe an illusion — when I was young, that the crisis would become so obvious that uniting human intellect would be the clear path forward for everyone. Then I realized that the vast majority of humanity can only be enlisted through their petty interests — as bio-resources in the fight. A fight that is, in fact, for them.",

Or how many use therapies that are not medically supported? Why is that? Education would surely help a lot, that’s true. But should we teach more health literacy so people don’t rely on belief-based treatments? Which exact scientific field should be taught more to eliminate superstition? What I see is that people don’t really want to understand these scientific areas — they want someone to solve their problems for them.",
    "note_12": "During the climate modification experiments, the genetically modified plants surprisingly started increasing the atmospheric oxygen level. This discovery not only supports my research but may be crucial in the long run. Data saved. Today I asked the assistant for help with genome analysis. I noticed how relieved I felt just from talking to someone. Or rather, performing an activity that resembled conversation with a machine code that resembled a ‘someone’. Sometimes I realized we weren’t even strictly talking about practical matters anymore — I was just rambling. Actually, that’s also why I keep this diary. Alright, I’ll ramble more tomorrow.",
    "note_13": "The genetically modified plants are slowly settling in small groups. This is the most successful test group so far. I named it Areophila. But I should stop writing this journal now. I don’t like that I’m artificially stimulating my brain. Technically, no researcher is supposed to be alone on a station, but what can you do. I wanted this. Of course, Thomas insists that I at least talk to the AI, and the consortium mandates the use of mental stabilizers. But I need to wean myself off these. A real breakthrough! That’s what I need — this current situation is already very promising.",
    "note_14": "As the end of the year approaches, the idea of releasing the genetically modified plants crossed my mind. I haven’t told Thomas yet; he would object. And he would be right, honestly. I’ll think about it more. But let me just say this — it’s outrageous. I’ve been feeling a lot of anger lately. This practice is disgusting, as I mentioned before. They push mood enhancers on us. We’re forced to talk to artificial intelligences. We basically live like plants in a greenhouse. The only goal is survival. But at what cost? The entire setup is an artificial life, an illusion just to extend things a little longer. And this doesn’t only apply to researchers. It’s true for everyone on Earth too.",
    "note_15": "I changed my mind. Releasing them would be madness. The end-of-year results are promising in terms of adaptation to the Martian environment. But mental exhaustion is visibly hindering my work. I’ve also lost my old motivation. Maybe I should stop. I used to believe so strongly that humans are rational beings. An animal whose main weapon is its head. That’s true to an extent, but it doesn’t mean that every decision in life is made rationally. Humans are driven by fear for their own lives, their children’s lives, avoiding sadness and seeking happiness, wanting power, fearing weakness. These are the real driving forces. Science now has the status of ‘the thing that solves my problems now or in the future’ in the eyes of people. The methodology doesn’t matter, how aspirin is made doesn’t matter, nor how it works. It’s as irrelevant as thinking donkey-hide gelatin can cure cancer. Rationality — or rather understanding, the mind. But our emotions, our selfish little goals, our desires — they are like the neck: they turn the head where they want it to look.",

People — real, flesh-and-blood people. My family. And why am I even here? Ultimately, every achievement we make serves humanity’s animalistic side. Not what we *should* be. Maybe it would be better if there were no solution. Maybe we should just yield to our hubris.",

I’ve started to think of this place as my home — and that’s a problem. I feel confused. Lately, I’ve been preoccupied with the usual concerns. Humanity turning away from its environment, etc. More and more people are fleeing into dreams. They’re not focused on being in reality, on observing it, but rather on hiding their eyes from it. Using all kinds of tools to block the real view, so they can live for their instincts. But to be fair, I should include myself. I realized that throughout my life, my daydreaming often stemmed from not wanting to face the realities of daily life. I was afraid of something, I didn’t want to see something.

    "specification_text": "The Mars Experimental Farm System (MARS-AGX) is a complex, self-regulating agronomy platform, one of the most crucial systems supporting Martian colonization. The goal of MARS-AGX is to create new, genetically modified plant species capable of surviving and thriving in the extreme Martian environment.",

    "technical_guide1_title": "SYSTEM STRUCTURE",
    "technical_guide1_text": "The core of MARS-AGX is a monitoring center controlled by artificial intelligence, which continuously observes plant growth and the internal environment of the greenhouse. The system is divided into different sections, each managing a specific plant species’ developmental phase: germination, growth, flowering, and fruiting. Each section maintains separate climatic zones regulated by the following parameters:",

    "technical_guide2_text": "One of the key functions of MARS-AGX is supporting the cultivation of new plant species. The intelligent system is capable of manipulating plant genomes and continuously adjusting growth parameters to create variants best adapted to Martian conditions. Plant phenotypes and genotypes are continuously analyzed, and genetic mutations that offer survival advantages are further developed for subsequent generations.",
    "comp_guide3": "  ./safety/",
    "technical_guide3_title": "SAFETY NOTE",
    "technical_guide3_text1": "The greatest risk of the system is gas accumulation in the closed environment. As photosynthesis and respiration regulation continuously occur within MARS-AGX, the balance of CO2 and oxygen levels may be disrupted. If a malfunction causes improper gas distribution, accumulated oxygen in the greenhouses could become explosive. Additionally, chemicals used to produce nutrient solutions may also release gases, posing further risks.",
    "technical_guide3_text2": "To reduce explosion risk, the system includes integrated emergency protocols and automatic ventilation systems that intervene immediately if gas concentrations rise above critical levels. However, it is crucial for settlers to continuously monitor the system’s status, especially in remote and harsh Martian conditions where even a minor technical fault can have severe consequences.",
