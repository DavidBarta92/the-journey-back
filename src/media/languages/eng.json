    "dia_C7_S16": "Not anymore. Not for a long time. But I often think about them and Earth. The birds, the beautiful plants, the sound of the wind. It's not like the wind here.",
    "dia_C7_S17": "Why did you come here?",
    "dia_C7_S18": "Because of my research. It was especially important for me to be here. You know that too.",
    "dia_C7_S19": "I know about you from what others have told me, what Mom told me.",
    "dia_C8_S1": "Is Mom mad at me?",
    "dia_C8_S2": "Not anymore. She said it was easier for you this way. We would need you on Earth. The world you left doesn't exist anymore...",
    "dia_C8_S3": "...because we didn't love it enough. News reaches me, and I'm very sorry. I'm sorry that you couldn't live on the Earth I did.",
    "dia_C8_S4": "Well, I also... It's terrible to wait for the end of the world every day. Our rivers dried up, millions suffer from poor air quality. Day by day, I can only think that we need to do something. I can't think of anything else but that there's no future.",
    "dia_C8_S5": "Is that why you came here?",
    "dia_C8_S6": "I... yes, I mean for you. To be together, to return among us.",
    "dia_C8_S7": "I want to show you something, but I can't go for it. Could you find it for me? It's in the drawer next to box B625 on the lower level.",
    "dia_C9_S1": "When you were born, we lived together. I lived with you until you were in school. I led the lab from there. Do you remember?",
    "dia_C9_S2": "It was at the end of the garden... I remember, in my childhood, I received wooden toys from you. I thought you made them by hand. It's so different in my memories of you. It was so long ago... It's strange; I know I played with you, that my memories are about you, but it's like you're a different person.",
    "dia_C9_S3": "I've thought a lot about you.",
    "dia_C9_S4": "You didn't look for us, and we didn't even know why you left.",
    "dia_C9_S5": "Later, we talked. I called you.",
    "dia_C9_S6": "But we were never together again. Like in my childhood. I just heard about you, often not from you. Then I started to be afraid that maybe the connection I'm nostalgic for didn't even form, and it hurt to think about it. It's better to feel that something is lost than to feel that it never existed. And now I don't know... I still don't know.",
    "dia_C9_S7": "When you wrote a few months ago, I was very happy. I'm very proud of you. I was especially glad when you wrote a few months ago about how distant our family had become. I think I made a lot of wrong decisions in my life, let life pass me by while I was hiding in my own world, hurting many people. I know I've missed a lot, and ironically, while I've been dealing with research for years, the climate and changes in the world, I just didn't realize how much and in what direction I changed. And now, not only do I have to go back to Earth, but also to my young self to make everything right.",
    "dia_C9_S8": "They said at the base that they tried to contact you several times, but you cut off contact with them. It didn't seem like you wanted to come back. It even seemed like you loved Mars more than Earth.",
    "dia_C9_S9": "For a while, I blamed it on work, that I was hiding. Then when I looked deep into myself, I realized that I couldn't reconcile with my conscience. That I was angry with myself for my omissions, and ironically, by doing so, I missed even more. I wasted years, and ironically, while I spent years dealing with research, climate, and world changes, I just didn't realize how much and in what wrong direction I changed. And now, not only do I have to go back to Earth, but also to my young self to make everything right.",
    "dia_C10_S1": "We'll be there soon.",
    "dia_C10_S2": "Are you sleeping?",
    "dia_C10_S3": "No, I'm awake.",
    "dia_C10_S4": "Everything okay?",
    "dia_C10_S5": "I was just thinking about what you think of me now.",
    "dia_C10_S6": "I think you made the right decision.",
    "dia_C10_S7": "I don't even know what else to say...",
    "dia_C10_S8": "Let's talk about the box you took from me.",
    "dia_C10_S9": "Th... The box you...",
    "dia_C10_S10": "B625, yes. I know about it.",
    "dia_C10_S11": "But it doesn't bother me. I knew you came because of that.",
    "dia_C10_S12": "Not ONLY because of that.",
    "dia_C10_S13": "I know that too. But you didn't dare to say it.",
    "dia_C10_S14": "I don't want to judge. Especially since I should have offered. After what I heard about it...",
    "dia_C10_S15": "This matter is important to me! And I was terribly disappointed that you wanted to keep it to yourself.",
    "dia_C10_S16": "I've thought a lot about this. What would be the right decision. I'm sure there was some defiance in it when I decided that people need to solve this on their own now.",
    "dia_C10_S17": "Do you remember, I once said that people see science as a tool? And unfortunately, they don't see it as a means of understanding but as a means of solving their own life problems.",
    "dia_C10_S18": "The time spent here changed me; I looked into myself. The question is who we are when we are alone. We usually want to dull our internal unresolved problems with some external stimulus. And society only reinforces this. How much opportunity does the world provide today for us to withdraw from it, to indulge in our passions, to move towards our desires? This is harmful not only because of addiction. It's harmful because we define ourselves by what we do and not by what we don't do. The world misleads us.",
    "dia_C10_S19": "I don't understand you. So, you didn't want to entrust humanity with the tool to save the planet?",
    "dia_C10_S20": "In reality, it's not our planet at stake, but the lives we are accustomed to. People were afraid even when I was young. There were no wars for water, no masses falling ill from the air back then. I worried that everything would go wrong before our eyes. I was angry at the rich, the companies, the politicians.",
    "dia_C10_S21": "Then I realized there is no one to replace them. If we randomly replaced the top 1% of humanity, we would end up in the same place within a year or two. I realized that I myself am part of the society that devours the planet. In fact, neither I, my friends, nor my family do anything.",
    "dia_C10_S22": "So, you chose to run away.",
    "dia_C10_S23": "So, I came here in my despair. This planet is as barren and hopeless as the world we created for ourselves on Earth. That's what I thought back then.",
    "dia_C10_S24": "Do you not think that way anymore?",
    "dia_C10_S25": "I think what is lost is only mine, our generation's. Individuals. Egos that can no longer live again in the world that used to be. But now I also know that there is something worth preserving. Now I know that even in this seemingly barren land, which everyone has given up on - including myself - there can be life. There's not much love in me for myself, but looking at you, I see that even from this soil, something hopeful can sprout.",
    "dia_C10_S26": "It seems cruel, but people learn from what they have to solve for themselves, not from what science saves them from. I realized that we cannot shape the world further according to our needs, even if that is instinctively our first thought. We have to shape ourselves to the world. That's what I want to pass on and not what's in the box.",
    "dia_C10_S27": "You don't have many choices now. The box is with me.",
    "dia_C10_S28": "And now it's your decision.",

    "journal_1": "On Monday, one of the most respected figures in the scientific world, Dr. Bolyai Teo, announced the permanent termination of his connection with the organization leading the research on Mars. Dr. Teo, a professor at the Institute of Plant Biology, has been at the forefront of research on the behavior of plants in the Mars Research Project, about which little concrete information has leaked to the public.",
    "journal_2": "As events unfolded, the mystery became even more intriguing when it was revealed that the results of the research are completely classified, and it is not known when the Martian base organization will share them with the public.",
    "journal_3": "Spokesperson Dr. Emily Whigham, responsible for information regarding Mars research, did not provide details on the matter. \"This is a sensitive period in our research, and we respect Professor Bolyai's decision. We hope this is only a temporary state, and he will participate in the project again in the future,\" said the spokesperson.",
    "journal_4": "Dr. Bolyai has been actively speaking out for many years on the relationship between climate change and the adaptability of plants. His work has gained significant recognition not only in the scientific community but also among the general public. Researchers who have worked directly with Dr. Teo are deeply shocked and puzzled by the professor's decision.",
    "journal_5": "However, some explain Dr. Bolyai's long absence and the current events as a failure of the research project. Critics, speaking anonymously, suggest that the professor may not have achieved the expected results in the Mars studies, and now he has made this drastic decision due to the project's long-term failure.",
    "journal_6": "The case continues to raise many questions, but both the scientific community and the public are watching closely to see whether Dr. Bolyai Teo will ever return to Martian research or permanently leave it behind. For now, the mysterious circumstances and the future of the research remain uncertain on Mars.",
