    "trivia_A_1_title": "The Vanishing Days and Nights: The Human Body's Adaptation",
    "trivia_A_1_text": "For Martian settlers, one of the greatest challenges is the length of days and nights. A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours and 39 minutes long, which may seem like a minor change initially, but it severely affects the human biological clock over the long term. The human body struggles to adapt to this new rhythm, causing sleep disorders, exhaustion, and psychological issues. Martian doctors have developed new 'rhythm stimulators' to regulate the body's internal clock to better fit Martian conditions. However, some settlers have chosen to adapt naturally, thereby creating new types of human life cycles.",   
    "trivia_A_2_title": "Terraforming: The Nature of the Paradox",
    "trivia_A_2_text": "During Mars' terraforming process, scientists encountered a peculiar paradox: the gradual transformation of the planet into a habitable environment poses the greatest risk to the current Martian settlers. The increasing oxygen levels and the slow rise in surface temperature trigger rapid changes that the human-built bases and domes have not adapted to properly. Ironically, those working on Mars' terraforming may find themselves in danger if these changes occur too quickly.",   
    "trivia_A_3_title": "The 'Mars Cathedral': A Symbol of Science",
    "trivia_A_3_text": "One of Mars' largest artificial structures is a massive domed building simply known as the 'Mars Cathedral.' This facility symbolizes the triumph of science, housing the research centers of the Martian colony. Here is where the scientists responsible for terraforming and the planet's future are based. People often come here to witness the wonders of science and draw inspiration for their efforts to save Earth. The 'ceremonies' held in the Cathedral celebrate scientific discoveries, and new scientific breakthroughs have replaced the modern religious holidays.",
    "trivia_A_4_title": "Martian Religion: The 'Cult of Rebirth'",
    "trivia_A_4_text": "A new form of religion has emerged on Mars that interprets the terraforming process on a spiritual level. Followers of the 'Cult of Rebirth' view Mars as a sacred place where humanity can start anew. For them, terraforming is not just a scientific process but also a symbolic rebirth. They believe that the transformation of Mars is part of humanity's spiritual renewal, and every step taken towards making the planet habitable brings them closer to a new, purer form of existence. This new religion is a peculiar blend of science and spirituality, combining rational thought with mystical belief.",
    
    "trivia_B_1_title": "Martian Plants: The Carbon Dioxide Planet",
    "trivia_B_1_text": "The biggest challenge in Martian agriculture is the planet's extreme carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, which, while providing energy for plants, makes it impossible for Earth-based plants to adapt to the extremely low temperatures and radiation damage. Scientists are trying to develop genetic modifications that would enable plants to use the Martian atmosphere for energy production while also withstanding radiation and cold. Experiments are ongoing, but no plant has yet survived the open Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_B_2_title": "The 'Photosynthesis Problem': Sunlight on the Red Planet",
    "trivia_B_2_text": "Mars is farther from the Sun, so sunlight intensity is significantly weaker than on Earth. This presents a serious obstacle for plants, as the sunlight needed for photosynthesis is much less. Scientists are working on developing plants that can generate energy from less light, but this remains a challenge. Some researchers are experimenting with artificial light sources to compensate for the lack of solar energy, but long-term sustainability is still uncertain.",
    "trivia_B_3_title": "The Plant Gene Bank: Seeds of Hope",
    "trivia_B_3_text": "On the Martian colony, there is a vast plant gene bank that stores thousands of Earth plant species. This gene bank is a symbol of hope for Martian settlers, as these seeds could form the basis of future Martian agriculture. Each plant species' genetic code is continually analyzed and modified to create varieties that might one day survive on the Martian surface. Research is ongoing, but it remains a distant dream for these seeds to eventually sprout on the red planet.",
    "trivia_B_4_title": "Cynara cardunculus var. areophila",
    "trivia_B_4_text": "The artichoke is a thistle-like vegetable and medicinal herb native to North Africa. It has been consumed since ancient Greek times. Due to its special abilities, such as high salt tolerance, heat resistance, and drought resistance, Martian researchers consider it a potential candidate for the future Martian ecosystem. Although a truly Martian-tolerant variant is still awaited, the Cynara cardunculus var. areophila is frequently mentioned, with 'Cynara' being the original genus and 'cardunculus' the specific name for the artichoke. The term 'areophila' refers to 'Mars,' the Greek god Ares, and '-phila' means 'lover' or 'friend,' so 'Mars-lover.'",
    
    "trivia_C_1_title": "The Basis of Interstellar Travel: Mental Stabilizers",
    "trivia_C_1_text": "For humanity, space travel has become routine, but the several-month journey between Earth and Mars poses a massive psychological burden for astronauts. The vast emptiness, the silent glow of the stars, and the endless silence have a daunting effect on astronauts' minds. Recent developments have introduced special 'mental stabilizers' that alleviate the mental pressure. These neurochemical-based devices prevent the mind from wandering, which can be caused by the oppressive emptiness of space.",

Travel between the planets is organized by both private companies and government agencies, utilizing the latest ion thrusters and nuclear-powered spacecraft, which significantly shorten the travel time.",
    "dia_C1_intro1-2": "   Mars bases operate hydroponic farms and recycling systems that enable self-sustaining life in the confined environment. The organization of travel and logistics between the planets is coordinated by an international space agency consortium, ensuring continuous supply and maintenance of research programs.",

Due to increasing Earth-based crises, supporting research and ensuring proper replenishment are becoming more difficult. As a result, the duration of astronauts' missions in Mars laboratories often depends on the researchers themselves, as long as it does not jeopardize the research.",

Az AI viszont olyasmi, aminél nem csak azt nem értjük, hogy a motorháztető alatt mi történik, hanem azt sem, hogy pontosan mi a dolgunk vele.

A tudomány mára egy olyan státuszban van az emberek szemében, hogy 'a dolog, ami most vagy a jövőben megoldja életem problémáit'. A módszertan lényegtelen, hogy hogy készül az aspirin, és az is lényegtelen, hogy miként fejti ki hatását.

The Greeks, in particular, were renowned for their navigation. I told you about Odysseus: ten long years he wandered the seas before finally finding his way home.

    "dia_C6_S4_op1_op1_op1_2":"Teo: In part... yes, you could say so. The Greeks not only observed and studied the planets, but they also coined the word itself. The term ‘planētēs’ originally meant ‘wanderer,’ derived from a verb meaning ‘to roam.’ It’s rather fitting, really, as planets—unlike the stars—seemed to wander across the sky, deviating from the fixed positions of the constellations. Greek astronomers noted this peculiar, irregular movement, which is why they associated it with wandering, with losing one’s way.",

    "dia_C6_S4_op1_op2_op1_2":"Teo: I imagine dragons were powerful symbols of the unknown and of danger—things people couldn’t understand or control. In stories and legends, these creatures were massive, fearsome, and undefeatable. The dragons drawn on maps of uncharted territory were a warning: ‘This place is dangerous, you don’t belong here!’",

Dragons and other mythical creatures slowly vanished, replaced by detailed geographic markers and precise descriptions of newly discovered lands. The world became colder, known, stripped of mystery. Now it’s just us, and we must face the full weight of everything we know.",

I drew so many maps back then. I liked how the old maps were a bit distorted. They showed what they needed to, but never quite right.",
    "dia_C6_S4_op1_op2_2":"Teo: Yes, I remember those drawings. I liked that too, actually—there was a certain charm to those old maps. Nowadays, we scan the terrain with satellites in perfect 3D. Back then, people had to rely on simple measurements and the mental maps they carried with them. It was as if the outer world and the inner world blended more closely together… The uncharted lands were full of challenges and dangers, and old maps often marked these places with symbols. Did you know that cartographers often drew dragons where no one had ventured yet? It wasn’t just a warning of danger but a tribute to the unknown itself. These ‘terra incognita,’ these dragons, were metaphors for the mysteries of the world.",

When I first arrived, the planet was even drier, and only now are we starting to see signs of marshes forming, the temperature rising slightly, and the atmosphere thickening. But it’s a slow process. Atmospheric pressure is still far too low for us to breathe unaided, and the soil is still filled with perchlorates, which are toxic. The goal is still quite distant.",

    "dia_C6_S4_op2_op1_op1_2":"Teo: Indirectly. My research would come into play in the second phase. For now, we’re still in the first phase—we need to melt the water and thicken the atmosphere. They’re currently planning to install giant mirrors in space to focus sunlight onto the Martian surface, increasing the temperature. There are also plans to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—or perhaps they've already started. The second phase will involve introducing plants. That’s where my work would come in.",

How should I put it… The names Phobos and Deimos remind us that fear and danger have always been a part of human experience, whether on the battlefield or in the exploration of space. But, of course, the main reason is that they’re Mars’ moons.",

    "dia_C6_S4_op2_op2_2":"Teo: Hm... yes, it’s quite common to see both Phobos and Deimos at the same time. It hardly registers with me anymore... But I used to gaze at them often. They were given special names; in Greek, they mean ‘fear’ and ‘terror’. Phobos and Deimos were the sons of Ares, the god of war. Whenever Ares went to battle, he brought these companions with him, spreading fear and panic during the fighting. Phobos and Deimos didn’t just appear as gods in myths but also as symbols of war itself—since fear and terror were inseparable from any conflict.",

    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op1_op2_2": "Teo: It’s part of human nature to fear what we don’t fully understand and to be cautious before crossing into the unknown. But this fear isn’t necessarily bad. It helps us to be more thoughtful.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op1_op2_3": "Aiza: Yes, though this fear often binds our hands. Since it’s about the unknown, we don’t know how cautious we should be. Especially when it concerns ourselves and we encounter something undiscovered while exploring our inner landscapes.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op2_op1_1": "Aiza: What do you think about facing these fears?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op2_op1_2": "Teo: Well, it’s time we did, but we do nothing. The absence of dragons doesn’t mean there’s nothing to fear. You know this well, coming from Earth. What’s happening there? We’re burning the place we live in, the signs are clear, yet no one does anything because of our nature. Only the present moment matters, otherwise, we bury our heads in the sand and act as if the future doesn’t exist.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op2_op2_1": "Aiza: Has the world really become so cold, or is it just how you perceive it?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op1_op2_op2_op2_2": "Teo: No, it’s not just me. Think about it; all the mystique has vanished from the world. We believe we know everything. But this confidence is actually very precarious, because knowledge often doesn’t bring peace; rather, it creates uncertainty. It’s like wandering while standing still, thinking we are making progress, but actually just spinning in place because we can’t find direction in our lives.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op1_op1_1": "Aiza: You said there were no breakthroughs? Is this what you meant?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op1_op1_2": "Teo: Well, there have been partial successes, like more resilient plants, etc. But overall, the situation remains that the soil is still incredibly dry and nutrient-poor, almost entirely lifeless. We need plants that don’t rely solely on soil for nutrients, but we haven’t reached that point yet.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op1_op2_1": "Aiza: Is there anyone continuing your research?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op1_op2_2": "Teo: Unfortunately, it hasn’t gone as planned. Most of my results and notes were destroyed in the accident. The materials I was working on are lost, so the work I started can’t continue. Although there are other researchers trying, I know of one on Z-482. My own research doesn’t really have a successor. The technology I developed is very specific, and it would now be difficult to return to where I left off. And I don’t think anyone else is making progress.",

    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op2_op1_2": "Teo: I don’t know how many years and how much energy it would take to significantly change the climate, but you have to see that this world doesn’t want us. It’s not like a harsh landscape on Earth. Here, there’s nothing but swamps, destructive storms, and cold. This planet had better days, but it’s frozen, desiccated, and I’m not sure it can be reversed. Not everything has a second chance.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op2_op2_1": "Aiza: Planting was your specialty, right?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op1_op2_op2_2": "Teo: Yes, exactly. My task was to create plants that could survive the Martian environment. We spent a lot of time in laboratory conditions, genetically modifying various Earth plants to better withstand the cold, radiation, and nutrient deficiency. However, every single experiment failed; this is a dead planet, and I fear it will remain that way.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op1_op1_1": "Aiza: How beautiful. I mean the image itself, as described.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op1_op1_2": "Teo: Mythology is full of beautiful symbols. Even without knowing psychology, I imagine it helped people understand and deal with their inner struggles. And perhaps not only on the battlefield... Sometimes, though, these stories are harsh and, if you will, caution us. There are stories like Prometheus or Atlas, who faced the gods. Both were eternally punished.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op1_op2_1": "Aiza: What have you learned from this?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op1_op2_2": "Teo: Hmm... I think the greatest lesson I’ve learned is that our greatest battles are always fought within. Although sometimes I feel that real-life problems, or perhaps just nowadays, are more complex than such stories can provide direction for. Often, they speak more about what not to do rather than what to do. For example, the stories of Atlas and Prometheus.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op1_1": "Aiza: This interpretation is interesting, but I think there is another part as well. War can be a metaphor for life, with fear as its companion. I see them as synonyms for the fear hidden within humans. How should I put it... Perhaps the greatest lesson is that our biggest struggles are always internal, and I think it’s worth remembering because it helps understand and manage our inner conflicts.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op1_2": "Teo: My struggles have failed. Perhaps what we should learn most from is not Phobos and Deimos, but the stories of Atlas and Prometheus.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op2_1": "Aiza: I enjoy these stories.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op2_2": "Teo: I’m glad. Perhaps there’s no better way to pass the time while we travel here than to recall them, much like the Greeks did at sea.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op2_3": "Aiza: Who else comes to mind?",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op2_4": "Teo: Hmm... there are many. For example, the cases of Prometheus or Atlas, who faced the gods. I think about them a lot lately; I fear that I, and indeed all of us here on Mars, have made similar mistakes. Both were punished for eternity.",

    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op1_op1": "Aiza: When I was a child, I didn’t pay attention to this, but Greek sailors' stories are not just about adventure. Each of them is also an inner journey. Often, it’s precisely the wandering, the sense of being lost in the unknown that leads to insights we would never find on a well-trodden path. These tales show that people in ancient times struggled with their own limitations just as we do today.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op1_op2": "Teo: The reality is that our world is full of challenges, but we are weak, and we can’t deal with it anymore. People today have turned away from reality, not just as individuals but as a whole. We deceive ourselves about the consequences of life. And even though a handful of people are working here, what will we achieve if we have a second Earth? Will it last forever?",
    
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op2_op1_1": "Teo: What do you mean by that?",
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op2_op1_2": "Aiza: Sometimes we hide things even from ourselves, as if we fear that if we confront them, those inner dragons will awaken and become dangerous. Others may never reach the point where they discover these hidden parts because they are afraid of what they might find there.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op2_op2": "Aiza: Since we were talking about dragons... It might be that we fear that if we confront these hidden fears or questions, those inner dragons we have buried so carefully will awaken and turn against us. This might shape the direction to move on this inner map.",
    
    "dia_C6_M2_op2_op1_op1": "Teo: This land is still dead. I don’t know how many years and how much energy it will take to significantly change the climate, but it’s clear that this world does not want us. It’s not like a harsh landscape on Earth. Here, there is nothing but swamps, destructive storms, and cold. This planet had better days, but it has frozen, dried up, and I’m not sure if it can be reversed. There isn’t always a second chance.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op2_op1_op2": "Teo: If you look around this terrain, you see nothing but barren peaks. If you observe the Martian topography, you can find traces of lakes and rivers that once existed here, now only the wind shapes the stones. My research lasted the longest here, and perhaps we came closest to awakening the planet, but it seems even that was not enough. It was all wasted time.",
    
    "dia_C6_M2_op2_op2_op1": "Teo: One of them stole the fire of intellect, the other defied the gods. They rebelled against the gods, contending with forces beyond their control. And to be honest, we’re doing the same thing. We took the fire of intellect and are using it to change the world. We want to create a new land from this desolate place while burning our own.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op2_op2_op2_1": "Aiza: Why do you identify with them?",
    "dia_C6_M2_op2_op2_op2_2": "Teo: Because there are stories that speak of how things can be irreversibly ruined. They defied the gods, contending with forces beyond their control. And to be honest, we’re doing the same thing. We took the fire of intellect and are using it to change the world. We want to create a new land from this desolate place while burning our own.",
    
    "dia_C6_M3_op1_op1_1": "Aiza: And on Earth, there are many people who can indeed face their problems...",
    "dia_C6_M3_op1_op1_2": "Teo: How many? Who? Because all I see is that no one is doing anything. How many are deceiving themselves with superstitions? They live in imagined worlds just to avoid dealing with reality, while their lives wither away. It was the same in the past and it’s the same now.",
    "dia_C6_M3_op1_op2_1": "Aiza: You did well deciding to return to Earth. It could be a new beginning.",
    "dia_C6_M3_op1_op2_2": "Teo: For whom? Certainly not for me. Aiza, I’m nearing the end of my life, and it’s no different with our world. The world has cooled, there are no colors in it. If you look around Earth, you see only people who have become disillusioned with society and escape into imagined worlds.",
    
    "dia_C6_M3_op2_op1_1": "Aiza: Why do you say that? Your research will be useful, or in some other way, there will be breakthroughs on Earth. Not everything is as lost as you think.",
    "dia_C6_M3_op2_op1_2": "Teo: Fine, let it be. There will be breakthroughs, eventually. And will we learn anything from them? Who are we doing all this for? Those who will populate Mars will be no different from those living on Earth. Will we just move on once we've used up Mars too? People lull themselves into believing that everything is fine and that there will be a solution.",
    "dia_C6_M3_op2_op2": "Teo: But what are we to do now? What next? I hear news from Earth and the situation hasn’t changed. Our biggest problem is actually ourselves. I hear about a series of disasters and at the same time, that there’s nothing wrong. People lie to each other, and people believe the lies.",

    "dia_C6_M4_op1_1": "Teo: It's a very wicked, unhappy, and corrupt world, and the situation is hopeless. People are tired, disillusioned, and have lost their purpose. They wander aimlessly, which is why I left.",
    "dia_C6_M4_op1_2": "Aiza: From what you’re saying, it seems to me that you were never truly happy. You didn’t like living on Earth if that’s all you saw of it. You portray everyone as foolish and powerless, but in reality, you’re just projecting your own feelings and helplessness onto others. You wouldn’t have left if I hadn’t come for you. But since it has come to this, look within yourself, think of the old stories if it helps... but start really coming back to us.",  
    "dia_C6_M4_op2_1": "Teo: It's a very wicked, unhappy, and corrupt world, and the situation is hopeless. The masses are deceived into thinking that there’s nothing wrong, and those who aren't deceived are powerless, disillusioned, and have lost their purpose. They wander aimlessly, which is why I left.",
    "dia_C6_M4_op2_2": "Aiza: Honestly, I don’t believe people are so foolish as to be deceived so easily. The problem lies elsewhere. You know? In reality, they’re avoiding an uncomfortable thought. The thought that while they’re hiding, they’re complicit in everything that causes their anxiety. There is no other way out but to face it. Movement is necessary! You’ve said so much bad about Earth, but to me, the worst part is that most people, including you, have now turned away from hope. Anything that is hopeful is false. Why do you think that is?",

    "note_24": "These plants, however innocent they seem now, could be dangerous for both Mars and Earth. Don’t trust Thomas’s judgment. He lies to me; I see that he only cares about success, not what I’ve created. Left me first, now wants to reap the rewards. Need to go back. Need to leave here, but don’t want to take the seeds with me.",
    "note_25": "What is reality? Don’t know. When the bird looked at the computer monitor, thought it had no idea what it was seeing. And what does the bird test at such a time? Despair? No, it just does what it can. But how can it live so ignorantly? Actually, it has no choice. Anyway, the bird is perfectly fine even if it understands nothing about the world. Now you are that bird looking at the monitor and thinking to yourself: I need to figure this out! Maybe sometimes you have a few bird-like thoughts. Maybe you’re just doing what you can.",

    "specification_title": "Mars Experimental Farm System: Technical Description",
    "specification_text": "The Mars Experimental Farm System (MARS-AGX) is a complex, self-regulating agronomy platform, one of the most crucial systems supporting Martian colonization. The goal of MARS-AGX is to create new, genetically modified plant species capable of surviving and thriving in the extreme Martian environment.",
    "comp_guide1": "  ./structure/",
    "technical_guide1_title": "SYSTEM STRUCTURE",
    "technical_guide1_text": "The core of MARS-AGX is a monitoring center controlled by artificial intelligence, which continuously observes plant growth and the internal environment of the greenhouse. The system is divided into different sections, each managing a specific plant species’ developmental phase: germination, growth, flowering, and fruiting. Each section maintains separate climatic zones regulated by the following parameters:",
    "technical_guide1_bullet1": "Light Intensity and Spectrum: Special LEDs with adjustable color temperatures and intensities, tailored to the different growth phases of the plants.",
    "technical_guide1_bullet2": "Temperature: Various temperature ranges for each module, continuously fine-tuned by AI based on plant responses.",
    "technical_guide1_bullet3": "CO2 and Oxygen Levels: Regulation of gases necessary for plant respiration and photosynthesis, which plays a critical role in growth cycles.",
    "technical_guide1_bullet4": "Soil Simulation: Hydroponic and aeroponic systems supplementing the barren Martian soil with necessary nutrients and water.",
    "comp_guide2": "  ./functions/",
    "technical_guide2_title": "RESEARCH FUNCTIONS",
    "technical_guide2_text": "One of the key functions of MARS-AGX is supporting the cultivation of new plant species. The intelligent system is capable of manipulating plant genomes and continuously adjusting growth parameters to create variants best adapted to Martian conditions. Plant phenotypes and genotypes are continuously analyzed, and genetic mutations that offer survival advantages are further developed for subsequent generations.",
    "comp_guide3": "  ./safety/",
    "technical_guide3_title": "SAFETY NOTE",
    "technical_guide3_text1": "The greatest risk of the system is gas accumulation in the closed environment. As photosynthesis and respiration regulation continuously occur within MARS-AGX, the balance of CO2 and oxygen levels may be disrupted. If a malfunction causes improper gas distribution, accumulated oxygen in the greenhouses could become explosive. Additionally, chemicals used to produce nutrient solutions may also release gases, posing further risks.",
    "technical_guide3_text2": "To reduce explosion risk, the system includes integrated emergency protocols and automatic ventilation systems that intervene immediately if gas concentrations rise above critical levels. However, it is crucial for settlers to continuously monitor the system’s status, especially in remote and harsh Martian conditions where even a minor technical fault can have severe consequences.",
