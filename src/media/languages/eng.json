    "trivia_A_1_title" : "The Disappearing Days and Nights: Adapting to the Day Cycles",
    "trivia_A_1_text" : "For Martian settlers, one of the greatest challenges is the length of the days and nights. A Martian day (sol) is 24 hours and 39 minutes long, which might seem like a minor difference at first, but in the long term, it significantly impacts the human biological clock. The human body struggles to adapt to this new rhythm, leading to sleep disorders, fatigue, and psychological issues. Martian doctors have developed new 'rhythm stimulators' to regulate the body's internal clock to better align with Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_A_2_title" : "Terraforming: An Ironic Effect",
    "trivia_A_2_text" : "During the process of terraforming Mars, scientists faced an ironic effect: the gradual transformation of the planet into a habitable environment poses the greatest risk to the current Martian settlers. The increasing oxygen levels and the slow rise in surface temperature are triggering rapid changes that the human-built bases and domes were not designed to withstand. Ironically, those working on terraforming Mars may themselves be at risk if the changes happen too quickly.",
    "trivia_A_3_title" : "The 'Mars Cathedral': A Symbol of Science",
    "trivia_A_3_text" : "One of Mars's largest artificial structures is a massive dome-shaped building simply called the 'Mars Cathedral.' This facility is a symbol of the triumph of science, a temple that houses the research centers of the Martian colony. Here, the scientists responsible for terraforming and the future of the planet work. People often come here to witness the wonders of science and draw inspiration for their efforts to save Earth. The 'ceremonies' held in the Cathedral celebrate scientific discoveries.",    
    "trivia_A_4_title" : "Martian Religion: The 'Cult of Rebirth'",
    "trivia_A_4_text" : "A new form of religion has developed on Mars, interpreting the terraforming process on a spiritual level. Followers of the 'Cult of Rebirth' view Mars as a sacred place where humanity can start anew. For them, terraforming is not only a scientific process but also a symbolic rebirth. They believe that transforming Mars is part of humanity's spiritual renewal, and every step taken to make the planet habitable brings them closer to a new, purer form of existence.",

    "trivia_B_1_title": "Martian Plants: The Carbon Dioxide Planet",
    "trivia_B_1_text": "The biggest challenge in Martian agriculture is the planet's extreme carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, which, while providing energy for plants, makes it impossible for Earth-based plants to adapt to the extremely low temperatures and radiation damage. Scientists are trying to develop genetic modifications that would enable plants to use the Martian atmosphere for energy production while also withstanding radiation and cold. Experiments are ongoing, but no plant has yet survived the open Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_B_2_title": "The 'Photosynthesis Problem': Sunlight on the Red Planet",
    "trivia_B_2_text": "Mars is farther from the Sun, so sunlight intensity is significantly weaker than on Earth. This presents a serious obstacle for plants, as the sunlight needed for photosynthesis is much less. Scientists are working on developing plants that can generate energy from less light, but this remains a challenge. Some researchers are experimenting with artificial light sources to compensate for the lack of solar energy, but long-term sustainability is still uncertain.",
    "trivia_B_3_title": "The Plant Gene Bank: Seeds of Hope",
    "trivia_B_3_text" : "On Mars, there is a vast plant gene bank that preserves thousands of Earth plant species. This gene bank is a symbol of hope for Martian settlers, as these seeds could form the foundation for future Martian agriculture. The genetic codes of each plant species are constantly analyzed and modified to create varieties that will one day be able to survive on the Martian surface. The research is ongoing, but it still seems like a distant dream that these seeds will one day sprout on the Red Planet.",
    "trivia_B_4_title": "Cynara cardunculus var. areophila",
    "trivia_B_4_text": "The artichoke is a thistle-like vegetable and medicinal herb native to North Africa. It has been consumed since ancient Greek times. Due to its special abilities, such as high salt tolerance, heat resistance, and drought resistance, Martian researchers consider it a potential candidate for the future Martian ecosystem. Although a truly Martian-tolerant variant is still awaited, the Cynara cardunculus var. areophila is frequently mentioned, with 'Cynara' being the original genus and 'cardunculus' the specific name for the artichoke. The term 'areophila' refers to 'Mars,' the Greek god Ares, and '-phila' means 'lover' or 'friend,' so 'Mars-lover.'",
    
    "trivia_C_1_title": "The Basis of Interstellar Travel: Mental Stabilizers",
    "trivia_C_1_text": "For humanity, space travel has become routine, but the several-month journey between Earth and Mars poses a massive psychological burden for astronauts. The vast emptiness, the silent glow of the stars, and the endless silence have a daunting effect on astronauts' minds. Recent developments have introduced special 'mental stabilizers' that alleviate the mental pressure. These neurochemical-based devices prevent the mind from wandering, which can be caused by the oppressive emptiness of space.",
    "trivia_C_2_title": "Reduced Gravity and Muscle Loss",
    "trivia_C_2_text": "The gravity on Mars is only 38% of Earth's, which can lead to significant muscle and bone loss for Martian settlers over time. The reduced gravity places less strain on muscles and bones, causing progressive bone density loss (osteoporosis) and muscle weakness. To counteract this, settlers must engage in daily gravitational training and resistance exercises using specialized equipment that simulates artificial gravity.",
    "trivia_C_3_title": "Radiation-Induced Genetic Damage",
    "trivia_C_3_text": "Mars's thin atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field provide no protection against cosmic radiation and solar wind, unlike Earth. Prolonged radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer and damages DNA, leading to potential genetic mutations. Researchers are continuously improving radiation-shielded habitat modules and clothing, but radiation exposure remains one of the greatest health challenges for Mars colonization.",
    
    "trivia_D_1_title": "How Does a Martian Plant Research Farm Work?",
    "trivia_D_1_text": "Martian plant research farms are closed, self-sustaining systems designed to develop and cultivate plants necessary for Mars colonization. The greenhouse modules use hydroponic and aeroponic systems to minimize water usage while providing optimal nutrient delivery. These farms are managed by artificial intelligence, which continuously monitors and adjusts the internal environment, such as temperature, light levels, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration. The research farms can analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of plants to identify species most adaptable to Martian conditions.",
    "trivia_D_2_title": "Air Circulation and Life Support on a Martian Base",
    "trivia_D_2_text": "The air circulation systems of Martian research farms and associated habitats operate on a closed-loop principle known as 'bioactive air filtration.' This system combines the natural photosynthesis of plants, which converts carbon dioxide into oxygen, with artificial filters and chemical catalysts that remove harmful substances from the air. A central air pump regulates air exchange between farm and habitat modules. Water and air recycling are tightly integrated into the system: moisture released through plant transpiration is captured by a condensation unit and reused in the hydroponic system, while the carbon dioxide exhaled by inhabitants is utilized for photosynthesis in the farm. Redundant systems ensure that no single failure endangers the ecosystem's functionality.",
    "trivia_D_3_title": "Failure of a Martian Farm",
    "trivia_D_3_text": "A Martian farm is an extremely sensitive system where small faults can lead to catastrophic consequences. One of the most vulnerable aspects is gas circulation and management. The closed atmosphere of the farm is optimized for controlling oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, but if the CO2 removal system fails, dangerous gas imbalances can quickly develop. Explosions can be triggered in the system through several mechanisms: gas accumulation, nutrient solution failures, or energy system malfunctions.",

    "dia_C1_intro1-2": "   Mars bases operate hydroponic farms and recycling systems that enable self-sustaining life in the confined environment. The organization of travel and logistics between the planets is coordinated by an international space agency consortium, ensuring continuous supply and maintenance of research programs.",

    "dia_C1_intro2-2": "   Although the consortium strives to maintain the astronauts' health, the rapid deterioration of Earth's climate and the insufficient number of researchers present significant challenges. Due to increasing Earth-based crises, supporting research and ensuring proper replenishment are becoming more difficult. As a result, the duration of astronauts' missions in Mars laboratories often depends on the researchers themselves, as long as it does not jeopardize the research.",
    "dia_C1_intro" : "Humanity has long dreamed of conquering Mars, and although the planet remains harsh and dangerous, terraforming has begun. Teó played a key role in this, having spent years here as the program's lead researcher. However, an accident changed everything.

Pontosan milyen tudományágat kéne többet tanítani, hogy eltűnjenek a hiedelmek?

A tudomány mára egy olyan státuszban van az emberek szemében, hogy 'a dolog, ami most vagy a jövőben megoldja életem problémáit'. A módszertan lényegtelen, hogy hogy készül az aspirin, és az is lényegtelen, hogy miként fejti ki hatását.

Back then, people relied on simple measurements and the mental maps they carried within. It’s as if the inner and outer worlds were more mixed. Unknown lands were full of challenges and dangers, and old maps often marked them with symbols. Did you know mapmakers would draw dragons where no one had been? It wasn’t just a warning about unknown dangers, but also a kind of tribute to the unknown. 'Terra incognita,' that’s what they wrote—dragons were metaphors, in a way.",

When I first arrived, the planet was even drier, and only now are we starting to see signs of marshes forming, the temperature rising slightly, and the atmosphere thickening. But it’s a slow process. Atmospheric pressure is still far too low for us to breathe unaided, and the soil is still filled with perchlorates, which are toxic. The goal is still quite distant.",

They’re currently planning to install giant mirrors in space to focus sunlight onto the Martian surface, increasing the temperature. There are also plans to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—or perhaps they've already started. The second phase will involve introducing plants. That’s where my work would come in.",

How should I put it… The names Phobos and Deimos remind us that fear and danger have always been a part of human experience, whether on the battlefield or in the exploration of space. But, of course, the main reason is that they’re Mars’ moons.",

They were given special names; in Greek, they mean ‘fear’ and ‘terror’. Phobos and Deimos were the sons of Ares, the god of war. Whenever Ares went to battle, he brought these companions with him, spreading fear and panic during the fighting. Phobos and Deimos didn’t just appear as gods in myths but also as symbols of war itself—since fear and terror were inseparable from any conflict.",

How do we move forward? Where do we go from here? There is no one who sees the bigger picture, who can tell us that we are wandering aimlessly. And since we are disconnected from both the past and the future, we are left with what we have. It keeps us anchored to the earth.",

We spent a lot of time in laboratory conditions, genetically modifying various Earth plants to better withstand the cold, radiation, and nutrient deficiency. However, every single experiment failed; this is a dead planet, and I fear it will remain that way.",

And perhaps not only on the battlefield... Sometimes, though, these stories are harsh and, if you will, caution us. There are stories like Prometheus or Atlas, who faced the gods. Both were eternally punished.",

    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op1_op2_2": "Teo: Hmm... I think the greatest lesson I’ve learned is that our greatest battles are always fought within. Although sometimes I feel that real-life problems, or perhaps just nowadays, are more complex than such stories can provide direction for. Often, they speak more about what not to do rather than what to do. For example, the stories of Atlas and Prometheus.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op1_1": "Aiza: This interpretation is interesting, but I think there is another part as well. War can be a metaphor for life, with fear as its companion. I see them as synonyms for the fear hidden within humans. How should I put it... Perhaps the greatest lesson is that our biggest struggles are always internal, and I think it’s worth remembering because it helps understand and manage our inner conflicts.",
    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op1_2": "Teo: My struggles have failed. Perhaps what we should learn most from is not Phobos and Deimos, but the stories of Atlas and Prometheus.",

    "dia_C6_M1_op2_op2_op2_op2_4": "Teo: Hmm... there are many. For example, the cases of Prometheus or Atlas, who faced the gods. I think about them a lot lately; I fear that I, and indeed all of us here on Mars, have made similar mistakes. Both were punished for eternity.",

    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op1_op1": "Aiza: When I was a child, I didn’t pay attention to this, but these stories aren’t just about adventure. What’s great about them is that each one is also an inner journey. Often, it’s precisely the wandering, the feeling of being lost in the unknown, that brings about realizations we could never find on a well-trodden path. These tales show that the people of ancient times struggled with their own limitations just like we do today.",

Others may never reach the point where they discover these hidden parts because they are afraid of what they might find there.",
    "dia_C6_M2_op1_op2_op2": "Aiza: Since we were talking about dragons... It might be that we fear that if we confront these hidden fears or questions, those inner dragons we have buried so carefully will awaken and turn against us. This might shape the direction to move on this inner map.",

Those who will populate Mars will be no different from those living on Earth. Will we just move on once we've used up Mars too? People lull themselves into believing that everything is fine and that there will be a solution.",

    "dia_C6_M4_op1_2": "Aiza: From what you’re saying, it seems to me that you were never truly happy. You didn’t like living on Earth if that’s all you saw of it. You portray everyone as foolish and powerless, but in reality, you’re just projecting your own feelings and helplessness onto others. You wouldn’t have left if I hadn’t come for you. But since it has come to this, look within yourself, think of the old stories if it helps... but start really coming back to us.",  
    "dia_C6_M4_op2_1": "Teo: It's a very wicked, unhappy, and corrupt world, and the situation is hopeless.

They wander aimlessly, which is why I left.",
    "dia_C6_M4_op2_2": "Aiza: Honestly, I don’t believe people are so foolish as to be deceived so easily. The problem lies elsewhere. You know? In reality, they’re avoiding an uncomfortable thought. The thought that while they’re hiding, they’re complicit in everything that causes their anxiety. There is no other way out but to face it. Movement is necessary! You’ve said so much bad about Earth, but to me, the worst part is that most people, including you, have now turned away from hope. Anything that is hopeful is false. Why do you think that is?",

I’m trying to figure out what happened to you, but you won’t let me in—you’re always lost in old memories, so distrustful. Why do you assume the worst right away?",

    "dia_C7_S11_1": "Teó: When I arrived, the program was already in full swing. I had been part of it from the beginning, but I only joined the Mars research later. In the beginning, I was busy managing the Earth-based team. We had some major successes, and using Thomas’ connections, we quickly secured the funding to relocate the research station off-planet within 10 years. Everyone said the Moon should be the first step, but we were adamant. That would have been a major step forward in terms of soil analysis, but the Moon has no atmosphere. Since the Earth's biosphere is rapidly deteriorating and extreme weather events are increasing, we needed to find a place that was as bad, or worse, than Earth would be in 50 years. Since Mars had already captured many people’s imaginations, there were plenty of volunteers to work on terraforming Martian plants.",
    "dia_C7_S11_2": "Teó: Thomas always understood people better, and he rose up to high circles. No wonder they sent him here first, to the Cathedral. After a while, though, it became untenable for me to work solely with the data sent back to Earth. We realized I needed to be here, especially when terraforming really got underway. Materials were being released from the melted soil that completely changed its quality. In some places, small lakes formed, and elsewhere geysers emerged. This allowed us to start working outside the Cathedral, in places where geological changes were taking place. I wasn’t exactly young then, but they made sure the consortium sent me here. Although I wasn’t a trained astronaut, I tried to acclimate quickly. I wanted to dive in, I can't stand helplessness, and I had sacrificed so many years for this, a whole life.",
    "dia_C7_S12_1": "Aiza: But things were still good between you two, right?",
    "dia_C7_S12_2": "Teó: Of course. However, when I got here, I noticed the disintegration. I couldn’t hold myself back for long. Thomas talks a lot about other projects, what they need to meet, how few people there are, etc. And all I felt was anger, that he dragged me here and this is what I got. I wanted everyone to focus solely on the biodome research at the Icarus base. The Cathedral didn’t go for that, and slowly people started to give in to the pressure. At one point, I said that anyone not working on my project could go back. So I continued alone.",
    "dia_C7_S14_1": "Aiza: But Thomas still kept in touch with you then.",
    "dia_C7_S14_2": "Teó: He was only interested in the results, that’s all. We talked some more, but it was just about practical matters. He’s no different from the other politicians or those running the consortium. He spent so much time with them, he became one of them. He just talks, but says nothing. I didn’t come here for that, I came to show something. I don’t want to be like them. Then, of course, I realized the consortium is like a tree, with roots that go deep. You don’t start with the leaders or the researchers here if you want to find those responsible.",
    "dia_C7_S15": "Aiza: Responsible people?",
    "dia_C7_S17_1": "Teó: Because nothing is happening. I was so naïve in the beginning. I thought this whole institution was a force that moved mountains, an incredible effort just to save the Earth.",
    "dia_C7_S17_2": "Aiza: And it’s not like that?",
    "dia_C7_S17_3": "Teó: Thomas once explained to me that the investors are already worried that the project will never pay off, that there’s been no result for so long. And that they’re putting much more money into projects aiming at colonizing the Moon and Mars. He said: 'You know, investment is a promise for the future.' Nobody cares about Earth anymore. Nobody... And the same thing will happen elsewhere.",

I really want to help, but that’ll only work if you face some things. I don’t want to hurt you, and I don’t want you to hurt yourself either. But you need to see that not everyone around you is evil, and it’s not that they always leave you behind. As long as you hide in this safe mourning, you’re actually abandoning everyone else.

Maybe it’s because I felt so alone when I was younger—maybe I still feel alone because of it. When we were together as kids, it really meant a lot to me. For some strange reason, I felt guilty for years. It was like... like there was a glass wall separating me from everything, and I felt like I was the one who put it there. I don’t know if you understand me. I work with people. I don’t think anyone could say I shut myself off from others.

Everyone worries about global warming, that 'we will destroy the planet.' We’re not even close to that. We’re going to destroy our comfortable lives.
