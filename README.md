## The Journey Back

I was always interested about game making and I did some mini games and prototypes before. For some reason I missed to create a "whole" project, I've only complesed my mini games, but I really wanted to make an interactive art which has begining and end, something witch by I can communicate with others and tell something.  In 2022 I wrote two game design document. I think both of these would be worth to be created but the first one is much more complicated than I could deal whit that at this point.

This one was my second idea, a simple point and click visual novel. The challenge is that I decided not to use a game engine for it. I write the "engine" using javascript and actually the whole game is an electron-react project. It's a good opportunity to exercise coding.
